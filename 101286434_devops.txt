DevOps describes a culture and set of processes that bring development and operations teams together to complete software development. It allows organizations to create and improve products at a faster pace than they can with traditional software development approaches. And, itâ€™s gaining popularity at a rapid rate.
DevOps is taking off. According to an April 2020 report from Global Market Insights, Inc., the market valuation of DevOps will reach $17 billion by 2026, proving that the appeal of shorter development life cycles, fewer deployment failures, more efficient communication and reduced cost is undeniable.
